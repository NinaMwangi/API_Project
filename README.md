Model Requirements:

Add at least 1 hidden layer with 128 neurons.

Ensure the number of classes matches your dataset.

Compile and Fit Model: Use appropriate metrics, optimizer, and loss function.

Save and Predict: Include saving the model and making predictions.

Submit via GitHub:

Include participant names in the README file.

Provide proof of participation (e.g., GitHub commits or Colab version history screenshot). Lack of this will result in point deduction.
